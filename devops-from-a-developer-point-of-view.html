          <h3>Devops From a Developer Point of View</h3>

          <div class="subtitle">as pondered by Mark Jubenville, 2021-02-18</div>

            Preamble time!
            <ul>
              <li>
                Hi everyone, for those that don't know me I'm Mark and I'm a
                Staff Web Developer. I joined ecobee a little over 2 years ago
                where I started off on the SmartBuildings team. And just
                recently I've moved over to the Zeus team.
              </li>

              <li>first time I've done this presentation</li>

              <li>
                most of the thoughts in here are from notes taken while I was
                doing development
              </li>

              <li>feel free to ask any questions at any time</li>

              <li>
                Why are these slides using reveal.js and not powerpoint? I sort
                of detest powerpoint. Mainly from my previous life as a graphics
                designer / prepress operator where clients would send files
                "designed" in powerpoint and expect them to print well.

                I think there are a multitude of things that can affect a
                developer when talking about devops, but these are the things I
                thought I'd go over a bit today

          <h3>What do I think of as devops?</h3>

          <div class="fragment fade-in">
            What do others consider to be devops?

          <div class="fragment fade-in">
            But what do I consider to be devops?
          </div>

          <div class="fragment fade-in">
            Sounds familiar, does this fit with Agile?
          </div>

          <div class="fragment fade-in">
            Is devops even being done at ecobee?
          </div>

          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>
                a very brief view of the devops model is generally considered to
                be operations and development working closely together
                throughout the product development process<br /><br />

                note: this isn't describing the role of a devops engineer, it's
                more about the devops process
              </li>

              <li>
                my version, and how I really think about devops, is that it's
                not just operations and development working closely together,
                it's operations, development, quality assurance and security all
                working closely together or even better all on the same team
              </li>

              <li>
                this can be very relatable to Agile; certainly one brand of
                agile says that ideally a team should have members on it for all
                tasks and skills required to successfully deliver a product<br /><br />

                note: there should still be other members and roles on a team of
                course, but these are the ones that broadly fit into the devops
                model
              </li>

              <li>
                going by this, most of us here are doing some form devops now<br /><br />

                any team with QA & engineers together could already be
                considered as part of a devops model<br /><br />

          <h3>Why should developers care?</h3>

          <div class="fragment fade-in">Automation</div>

          <div class="fragment fade-in">Reliability</div>

              <li>
                but these are the ones that resonate with me the most, where
                I've had the most pain points in the past
              </li>

              <li>
                to some extent, all of these things are already done at ecobee,
                but are maybe taken for granted
              </li>

              <li>
                but they are all things that quite often devs will think of as
                outside of their scope or control
              </li>

              <li>
                automation<br /><br />

                what does it get: faster releases, faster dev feedback cycle,
                faster testing anecdote on manual process: back at in the olden
                days, deployments were frequently done manually... I've worked
                in environments where they were done by scp'ing files to a
                production server, or by logging into a production server and
                running `git pull` and then restarting a service<br /><br />
              </li>

              <li>
                observability<br /><br />

                monitoring: once code is released, that's not the end step for a
                developer, being able to monitor the status of your deployed
                application is necessary<br /><br />

                debugging: ever try debugging something and wishing you had more
                access to logs that you don't directly control? for instance web
                server logs, database logs, file system logs<br /><br />

                the devops model, where ops is either integrated with your team
                or conversing on a daily basis helps with all these things<br /><br />
              </li>

              <li>
                reliability<br /><br />

                anecdote on testing: for a while one company I worked with had a
                single QA team, they would write out test cases for each dev
                team, the backlog of them was long, and their backlog of
                executing the tests was even longer<br /><br />
